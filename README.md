### Hi there 👋

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muesli/muesli/master/assets/termenv.png" width="260">

I'm Chris, an open-source enthusiast and avid contributor. I'm the author of [duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf),
[gitty](https://github.com/muesli/gitty), [Beehive](https://github.com/muesli/beehive), [Knoxite](https://github.com/knoxite/knoxite)
 and a bunch of other [projects](https://fribbledom.com/projects/). Curious what I've been working on recently?

(Love the logo on the right as much as I do? The awesome [Christian Rocha](https://github.com/meowgorithm/) made it!)
